# script-droid
A template for creating android applications using the three web based languages - Html, Css and Javascript.

This template has bootstrap and Jquery presinstalled.


script-droid supports android versions 3.0 (HoneyComb) and later.

This application was designed with android studio which google recently moved to from eclipse. I recommend that you import this project into android studio in order to compile it. You can use android studio to test and debug your application using an android emulator or a real android device.
